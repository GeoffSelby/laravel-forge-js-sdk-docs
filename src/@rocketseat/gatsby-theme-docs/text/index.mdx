# Introduction

Laravel Forge JavaScript SDK is a complete JavaScript wrapper for the official [Laravel Forge API](https://forge.laravel.com/api-documentation). It was designed to be compatible with both Node.js backends and client-side browsers.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Using Yarn (recommended)
yarn add @geoffcodesthings/forge-js

# Using NPM
npm install --save @geoffcodesthings/forge-js
```

### Basic Usage

The SDK uses the `fetch` api to make http requests to the Forge API. Because these calls are asynchronous, be sure to use `async/await`. Of course, you could resolve the promise with `.then()` if you prefer.

```js
import Forge from '@geoffcodesthings/forge-js';

const forge = new Forge('API_TOKEN');

const servers = await forge.servers.get();

console.log(servers);
```
